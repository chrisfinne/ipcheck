check your ip address as seen by different ports

When I'm on a corporate network (even when VPN'ing) that uses a web proxy, when I check my external ip address to add to my whitelist on my Amazon AWS security groups, it shows the ip address of the web proxy, not the ip address as seen via SSH port 22 or RDP port 3389 or MySQL port 3306.

This is a simple site to allow you to check your ip address as seen by different destination ports.
